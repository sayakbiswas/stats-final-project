\section{PSA Level Modeling}
\subsection{Introduction}
\par
The problem is to model the prostate-specific antigen(PSA) with respect to some clinical measurements. The provided number of data points in the sample is 97. I calculated some descriptive statistics on the sample provided. The mean PSA level of the sample is 23.73 mg/ml with a standard deviation of 40.78 mg/ml and a median value of 13.33 mg/ml.
\par
Since we are to model PSA Level, we take it as the response variable and the rest as the variables as the predictors. To get an initial idea about the kind of relationship PSA Level has with the other variables we plot scatter graphs. Unfortunately, with this data set te scatterplots don't quite paint a clear picture of the relationship between the variables except \textit{PSA Level vs. Cancer Volume} which seems to present a slight positive relationship. So, next we create a correlation matrix of the various variables. We can see that there is a moderately positive correlation between \textit{Cancer Volume} and \textit{Capsular Penetration}.

Keeping the previous observations in mind, we now develop a full linear model using all the predictors and without any interaction terms. Assuming all the model assumptions are met(we will verify this later), we test the overall fit of the model with the below hypotheses:\\
$H_0: \beta_1=...=\beta_7=0$ vs $H_a: \text{at least one of them} \neq 0$\\
This initial model has $R^2 = 45.85\%$ and ${R^2}_{adj} = 41.59\%$. This means that this model is able to explain a large portion of the variability. Also the test statistic value is $T.S. = 10.77$ with an associated p-value of almost 0 found using an $F_{7,39}$ distribution.
